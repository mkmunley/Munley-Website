## Mary Kate

My family has a spunky 13 year-old Bichon Frise while I personally am a proud mom to a red-footed tortoise named Georgia. I estimate she is approximately 5 years old but I have only had her for about a year. I personally will be adding a portuguese water dog puppy to the mix in late summer/early fall 2022 and am looking forward to having my own dog.
