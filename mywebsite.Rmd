## Mary Kate
I grew up in Saratoga Springs, New York before moving to Bedford, New Hampshire to complete High school. I am the oldest of three kids. My younger brother is also a student at UNH and my sister is still in high school. My family has a spunky 13 year-old Bichon Frise while I personally am a proud mom to a red-footed tortoise named Georgia. I estimate she is approximately 5 years old but I have only had her for about a year. I will be adding a portuguese water dog puppy to the mix in late summer/early fall 2022.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Marine Biology at UNH in May of 2021. As an undergraduate I began working for Dr. Elizabeth Fairchild as an aquaculture technician my Junior year. Senior year I began working on a project studying the bait preference of Channeled Whelk. In my free time I like to paint, draw, and go to the beach.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
