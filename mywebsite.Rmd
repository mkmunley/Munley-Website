## Mary Kate
I grew up in Saratoga Springs, New York before moving to Bedford, New Hampshire to complete High school. I am the oldest of three kids. My younger brother is also a student at UNH and my sister is still in high school. My family has a spunky 13 year-old Bichon Frise while I personally am a proud mom to a red-footed tortoise named Georgia. I estimate she is approximately 5 years old but I have only had her for about a year. I will be adding a portuguese water dog puppy to the mix in late summer/early fall 2022.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Marine Biology at UNH in May of 2021. As an undergraduate I began working for Dr. Elizabeth Fairchild as an aquaculture technician my Junior year. Senior year I began working on a project studying the bait preference of Channeled Whelk. In my free time I like to paint, draw, and go to the beach.
